Day 1 Notes – RHEL 10 Initial Setup

Hostname: rhel10-lab01
Username: user1
Kernel Version: 6.12.0-124.8.1.el10_1.x86_64

Today I installed RHEL 10 on VMware Fusion and created my main non-root administrator user. I verified that the hostname was set correctly, confirmed network connectivity, and updated the system using dnf. I created the directory I will be using to store my daily lab notes and started documenting everything I am doing so I can track my progress and build a portfolio.

Commands used today included checking the hostname, checking and applying updates, verifying connectivity, navigating directories, creating folders, and creating a notes file. I also confirmed that my environment is stable and ready for further labs.

What I learned today:
– How to install RHEL 10 properly
– Why hostname, network checks, and updates are done immediately after installation
– How important documentation is for real sysadmin work
– Basic navigation and filesystem understanding
– How to begin structuring a personal sysadmin lab

Directory path used today: /home/user1/day1

Questions or things to revisit:
– Continue practicing navigation and command usage
– Improve comfort with vim
– Review the filesystem hierarchy in detail tomorrow

Next steps:
– Push these notes to GitHub
– Begin Day 2: Linux navigation, basic commands, and filesystem structure
