Today I focused on strengthening on-system troubleshooting using native Linux documentation tools inside RHEL 10. In real production environments where external internet access is often restricted, built-in documentation becomes the primary source of truth for safe system changes and incident response.

What I worked on today:
• Navigated and interpreted man pages for system and admin commands
• Used apropos and whatis for command discovery by keyword
• Validated command behavior and flags using --help
• Applied man page sections 1, 5, and 8 for commands, config files, and admin utilities
• Completed a hands-on task using only on-system documentation

This directly supports real-world system administration and security operations where accuracy, speed, and misconfiguration prevention matter.
